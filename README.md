# This is a attempt of POC for a school project

## Only for your eyes

This code is just given as prouf of failure, it should not be taken.

## For malades mentaux 

1. Clone this repository
2. Install project from [Erik Bernhardsson](https://erikbern.com/2016/01/21/analyzing-50k-fonts-using-deep-neural-networks.html) in a subdirectory called *deep_fonts* (ps, good luck, it's in python2)
3. Install for python3 opencv, keras, numpy (sorry if something is missing in the list)
4. Once all installation is done : call generate_fonts_ with python2, it's supposed to generate a data.csv and lot of fonts
5. Open test_ml and uncommand "model = train..." and "save(model.... ", comment other lines in the files (exept imports of course)
6. Once model is trained, you should have a test_model.json and test_model.h5
7. You inverse commented lines in test_ml to have a prediction : spoiler, that will give the same resultat for all drawing you will test

Don't try to ask help from me, I'm not skilled with python, and will try to avoid it as possible
